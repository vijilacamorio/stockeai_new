All employees requesting time off for military service must provide advance notice to their immediate
supervisor, unless military necessity prevents such notice, or it is otherwise impracticable. Continuation of
health insurance benefits is available during military leave subject to terms and conditions of the group
health plan and applicable law.

Employees are eligible for reemployment for up to five years from the date their military leave began. The
period in an individual has to apply for reemployment or report back to work after military service is based
on time spent on military duty and on applicable law. For reinstatement guidelines. Contact the owner.

Employees who qualify for reemployment will return to work at a pay level and status equal to which they would
have attained had they not taken military leave. They will be treated as though they were continuously
employed for purposes of determining benefits based on length of service.

<span  class="c_name"><?php echo $this->session->userdata('company_name'); ?></span> complies with all rights
and protections under all applicable state laws granting time off for service, training and other obligations
in the uniformed services. This includes, but it not limited to, benefits entitlement and continuation, notice
and recertification requirements, and reemployment application requirements.

Questions regarding this policy should be directed to the owner.

<b>Jury Duty</b>

<span  class="c_name"><?php echo $this->session->userdata('company_name'); ?></span> encourage employees to
fulfill their civic responsibilities when called upon to serve as a juror. Employees must provide their
immediate supervisor with a copy of their jury summons as soon as possible so that the supervisor may make
arrangements to accommodate their absence.

Employees on jury duty must report to work on workdays, or parts of workdays, when they are not required to
serve. Either <span  class="c_name"><?php echo $this->session->userdata('company_name'); ?></span> or the
employee may request an excuse from jury duty if it is determined that the employee’s absence would create
serious operational difficulties.

Jury duty will be paid if required by applicable law. if paid, jury duty pay will be calculated on the
employee’s base pay rate times the number of hours the employee would otherwise have worked on the day of the
absence. If exempt employees miss work because of jury duty, they will receive their full salary, unless they
miss the entire workweek. However, <span  class="c_name"><?php echo $this->session->userdata('company_name');
?></span> may offset any jury-duty fees received by an exempt employee against the salary due for that
workweek.

<b>Worker’s Compensation</b>
	
Employees who are injured on the job at <span  class="c_name"><?php echo
$this->session->userdata('company_name'); ?></span> are eligible for Worker’s Compensation benefits. Such
benefits are provided at no cost to employees and cover any injury or illness sustained in the course of
employment that requires medical treatment.

Lost time or medical expenses incurred as a result of an accident or injury which occurred while an employee
was on the job will be compensated for in accordance with workers’ compensation laws. This protection is paid
for in fill by <span  class="c_name"><?php echo $this->session->userdata('company_name'); ?></span>. No
premium is charged for this coverage and no individual enrollment is required. <span  class="c_name"><?php
echo $this->session->userdata('company_name'); ?></span> will provide medical care and a portion of lost wages
through our insurance carrier.

All job-related accidents or illnesses must be reported to an employee’s supervisor immediately upon
occurrence. Supervisors will then immediately contact the owner to obtain the required claim forms and
instructions.

The policy is not intended to restrict and employee’s right to discuss, or act together to improve, wages
benefits and working conditions with co-workers or in any way restrict employees’ rights under the National
Labor Relations Act.

Questions regarding this policy should be directed to the owner.

<b>Workplace Violence</b>

<span  class="c_name"><?php echo $this->session->userdata('company_name'); ?></span> strictly prohibits

observe or that appears problematic. Employee reports made pursuant to this policy will be investigated
promptly and will be kept confidential to the maximum extent possible. <span  class="c_name"><?php echo
$this->session->userdata('company_name'); ?></span> will not tolerate any form of retaliation against any
employee for making a report under this policy.

<span  class="c_name"><?php echo $this->session->userdata('company_name'); ?></span> will take prompt remedial
action, up to and including immediate termination, against any employee found to have engaged in threatening
behavior or acts of violence.


<b>Drug & Alcohol Use</b>

<span  class="c_name"><?php echo $this->session->userdata('company_name'); ?></span> is committed to
maintaining a workplace free of substance abuse. No employee or individual who performs work for <span
class="c_name"><?php echo $this->session->userdata('company_name'); ?></span> is allowed to consume, possess,
sell, purchase, or be impaired by alcohol or illegal drugs, as defined under federal and/or state law, on any
property owned or leased on behalf of <span  class="c_name"><?php echo
$this->session->userdata('company_name'); ?></span>, or in any vehicle owned or leased on behalf of <span
class="c_name"><?php echo $this->session->userdata('company_name'); ?></span>.

The use of over-the-counter drugs and legally prescribed drugs is permitted as long as they are used in the
manner for which they were prescribed and provided that such use does not hinder an employee’s ability to
safely perform their job. Employees should inform their supervisor if they believe their medication will
impair their job performance, safety or the safety of others, or if they believe they need a reasonable
accommodation when using such medication.

<span  class="c_name"><?php echo $this->session->userdata('company_name'); ?></span> will not tolerate
employees who report to work while impaired by the use of alcohol or drugs. All employees should report
evidence of alcohol or drug abuse to their supervisor or the owner immediately. In cases in which the use of
alcohol or drugs creates an imminent threat to the safety of persons or property, employees are required to
report the violation. Failure to do so may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of
employment.

As a part of our effort to maintain a workplace free of substance abuse, <span  class="c_name"><?php echo
$this->session->userdata('company_name'); ?></span> employees may be asked to submit a medical examination
and/or clinical testing for the presence of alcohol and/or drugs. Within the limits of federal, state, and
local laws. <span  class="c_name"><?php echo $this->session->userdata('company_name'); ?></span> reserves the
right to examine and test for drugs and alcohol at our discretion.

As a condition of your employment with <span  class="c_name"><?php echo
$this->session->userdata('company_name'); ?></span> employees must comply with this Drug & Alcohol Use Policy.
Be advised that no part of the Drug & Alcohol Use Policy shall be construed to alter or amend that at-will
employment relationship between <span  class="c_name"><?php echo $this->session->userdata('company_name');
?></span> and its employees.

Employees found in violation of this policy may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including
termination of employment.

<b>Sexual & Other Unlawful Harassment</b>

<span  class="c_name"><?php echo $this->session->userdata('company_name'); ?></span> is committed to a work
environment in which all individuals are treated with respect. <span  class="c_name"><?php echo
$this->session->userdata('company_name'); ?></span> expressly prohibits discrimination and all forms of
employee harassment base on race, color, religion, sex, pregnancy, national origin, age, disability, military
or veteran status, or status in any group protected by state or local law.

Sexual Harassment is a form of discrimination and is prohibited by law. For purposes of this policy sexual
harassment is defined as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical
conduct of a sexual nature when this conduct explicitly or implicitly affects an individual’s employment,
unreasonably interferes with an individual’s work performance, or creates and intimidating, hostile or
offensive work environment. Unwelcome sexual advances (either verbal or physical), requests for sexual favors,
and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment when: (1) submission to
such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term of condition of employment; (2) submission or
rejection of the conduct is used as a basis for making employment decisions; or, (3) the conduct has the
purpose of effect of interfering with work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive work
environment.

Sexual and unlawful harassment may include a range of behaviors and may involve individuals of the same or
different gender. These behaviors include, but are not limite to:

* Unwanted sexual advances or requests for sexual favors
* Sexual or derogatory jokes, comments, or innuendo
* Unwelcomed physical interaction

* Abusive or malicious conduct that a reasonable person would find hostile, offensive, and unrelated to the
organization’s legitimate business interests
* Any other visual, verbal, or physical conduct or behavior deemed inappropriate by the organization

Harassment on the basis of any other protected characteristic is also strictly prohibited

<b>Complaint Procedure</b>

<span  class="c_name"><?php echo $this->session->userdata('company_name'); ?></span> strongly encourages the
reporting of all instances of discrimination, harassment, or retaliation. If you believe you have experienced
or witnessed harassment or discrimination based on sex, race, national origin, disability, or another factor,
promptly report the incident to your supervisor. If you believe it would be inappropriate to discuss the
matter with your supervisor, you may bypass your supervisor and report if directly to:

Arulkanth SreeKumar

3561 Lincoln Highway E, Kinzers, PA 17535

7325247707

Any reported allegations of harassment or discrimination will be investigated promptly, thoroughly, and
impartially.

Any employee found to be engaged in any form of sexual or other unlawful harassment may be subject to
disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment

<b>Retaliation Prohibited</b>

<span  class="c_name"><?php echo $this->session->userdata('company_name'); ?></span> expressly prohibits
retaliation against any individual who reports discrimination or harassment or assists in investigating such
charges. Any form of retaliation is considered a direct violation of this policy and, like discrimination or
harassment itself, will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.




<b>Telephone Usage</b>

<span  class="c_name"><?php echo $this->session->userdata('company_name'); ?></span> telephones are intended
for the sole use of conducting company business. Personal use of the organization’s telephones and
individually owned cell phones during business hours should be kept to a minimum or for emergency purposes
only. We ask that personal calls only be made or received outside of working hours, including during lunch or
break time. Long distance phone callas which are not strictly business-related are expressly prohibited.

Any employee found in violation of this policy will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including
termination of employment.



<b>Personal Property</b>

Employees should use their discretion when bringing personal property into the workplace. <span
class="c_name"><?php echo $this->session->userdata('company_name'); ?></span> assumes no risk for any loss or
damage to personal property.

Additionally, employees may not possess or display any property that may be viewed as inappropriate or
offensive on <span  class="c_name"><?php echo $this->session->userdata('company_name'); ?></span> premises.

<b>Use of Company Property</b>

Company property refers to anything owned by the company: physical, electronic, intellectual, or otherwise.
The use of company property is for business necessity only.

When materials or equipment are assigned to an employee for business, it is the employee’s responsibility to
see that the equipment is used properly and cared for properly. However, at all times, equipment assigned to
the employee remains the property of the organization, and is subject to reassignment and/or use by the
organization without prior notice or approval of the employee. This includes, but is not limited to, computer
equipment and data stored thereon, voicemail, records, phones, and employee files.

<span  class="c_name"><?php echo $this->session->userdata('company_name'); ?></span> has created specific
guidelines regarding the use of company equipment. Below is a list of employee responsibilities and
limitations with regards to company property.

Personal use of company property

Company property is NOT permitted to be taken from the premises without proper written authority form company
management.

<b>Company Tools:</b>

All necessary tools are furnished to employees in order to assist them in their required duties. Each employee
is, in turn, responsible for these tools. Tools damaged or stolen as a result of an employee’s negligence
will, to the extent permitted by federal, state and local law, be charged to the employee.





<b>Care of Company Property:</b>

Office areas should be kept neat and orderly and all equipment should be well maintained. The theft,
misappropriation, or unauthorized removal, possession, or use of company property or equipment is expressly
prohibited.

Any action in contradiction to the guidelines set herein may result in disciplinary action, up to and
including termination of employment.

<b>Smoking</b>

<span  class="c_name"><?php echo $this->session->userdata('company_name'); ?></span> provides a smoke-free
environment for its employees, customers, and visitors. Smoking, including the use of e-cigarettes and
vaporizers, is prohibited throughout the workplace. We have adopted this policy because we have a sincere
interest in the health of our employees and in maintaining pleasant working conditions.


<b>Visitors in the Workplace</b>

To ensure the safety and security of <span  class="c_name"><?php echo
$this->session->userdata('company_name'); ?></span> and its employees, only authorized visitors are permitted
on organization premises and in organization facilities.

All visitors must enter through the main reception area and sign in and out at the front desk. All visitors
are also required to wear a “visitor” badge while on <span  class="c_name"><?php echo
$this->session->userdata('company_name'); ?></span> premises. Authorized visitors will be escorted to their
destination and must be accompanied by a representative of the organization at all times.

Computer, Email & Internet Usage

Computers, email, and the internet allow <span  class="c_name"><?php echo
$this->session->userdata('company_name'); ?></span> employees to be more productive. However, it is important
that all employees use good business judgement when using <span  class="c_name"><?php echo
$this->session->userdata('company_name'); ?></span>’S electronic communications systems (ECS).

<b>Standards of Conduct and ECS</b>

<span  class="c_name"><?php echo $this->session->userdata('company_name'); ?></span> strives to maintain a
workplace free of discrimination and harassment. Therefore, <span  class="c_name"><?php echo
$this->session->userdata('company_name'); ?></span> prohibits the use of the organization’s ECS for bullying,
harassing, discriminating, or engaging in other unlawful misconduct, in violation of the organization’s policy
against discrimination and harassment.

<b>Copyright and other Intellectual property</b>

Respect all copyright and other intellectual property laws. For the organization’s protection as well as your
own, it is critical that you show proper respect for the laws governing copyright, fair use of copyrighted
material owned by others, trademarks and other intellectual property, including the organization’s own
copyrights, trademarks and brands. Employees are also responsible for ensuring that, when sending any material
over the Internet, they have the appropriate distribution rights.

<span  class="c_name"><?php echo $this->session->userdata('company_name'); ?></span> purchases and licenses
the use of various computer software for business purposes and does not own the copyright to this software for
use on more than one computer. Employees may only use software according to the software license agreement.
<span  class="c_name"><?php echo $this->session->userdata('company_name'); ?></span> prohibits the illegal
duplication of software and its related documentation.

<b>ECS Guidelines</b>

The following behaviors are examples of previously stated or additional actions under this policy that are
prohibited:

* Sending or posting discriminatory, harassing, or threatening messages or images about coworkers, supervisors
or the organization that violate the organization’s policy against discrimination and harassment.
* Stealing, using, or disclosing someone else’s code or password without authorization
* Pirating or downloading organization-owned software without permission
* Sending or posting the organization’s confidential material, trade secrets, or non-public proprietary
information outside of the organization. Wages and other conditions of employment are not considered
confidential material.
* Violating copyright laws and failing to observe licensing agreements.
* Participating in the viewing or exchange of pornography or obscene materials
* Sending or posting messages that threaten, intimidate, coerce, or otherwise interfere with the job
performance of fellow employees.
* Attempting to break into the computer system of another organization or person.
* Refusing to cooperate with a security investigation.
* Using the internet for gambling or any illegal activities.
* Sending or posting messages that disparage another organization’s products or services.
* Passing off personal views as representing those of <span  class="c_name"><?php echo
$this->session->userdata('company_name'); ?></span>.

<b>Privacy and Monitoring</b>

Computer hardware, software, email, internet connections, and all other computer, data storage or ECS provided
by <span  class="c_name"><?php echo $this->session->userdata('company_name'); ?></span> are the property of
<span  class="c_name"><?php echo $this->session->userdata('company_name'); ?></span>. Employees have no right
of personal privacy when using <span  class="c_name"><?php echo $this->session->userdata('company_name');
?></span>’S ECS. To ensure productivity of employees, compliance with this policy and with all applicable
laws, including harassment and anti-discrimination laws, computer, email and internet usage may be monitored.

This policy is not intended to restrict an employee’s right to discuss, or act together to improve, wages,
benefits and working conditions with co-workers or in any way restrict employee’s rights under the National
Labor Relations Act.

Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
Questions or concerns related to this policy should be directed to you supervisor or the owner.
	
	



</b>Company Supplies</b>

Only authorized persons may purchase supplies in the name of <span  class="c_name"><?php echo
$this->session->userdata('company_name'); ?></span>. No employee whose regular duties do not include
purchasing shall incur any expense on behalf of <span  class="c_name"><?php echo
$this->session->userdata('company_name'); ?></span> or bind <span  class="c_name"><?php echo
$this->session->userdata('company_name'); ?></span> by any promise or representation without express written
approval.

<strong>Timekeeping & Payroll</strong>

<b>Attendance & Punctuality</b>
	
Absenteeism and tardiness place an undue burden on other employees and on the organization. <span
class="c_name"><?php echo $this->session->userdata('company_name'); ?></span> expects regular attendance and
punctuality from all employees. This means being in the workplace, ready to work, at your scheduled start time
each day and completing your entire shift. Employees are also expected to return from all scheduled meal and
break periods on time.

All time off must be requested in writing, in advance, as outlined in the organization’s Paid Time Off (PTO)
policy. If an employee is unexpectedly unable to report for work for any reason, he or she must directly
notify their supervisor as early as possible, and preferably prior to their scheduled starting time. It is not
acceptable to leave a voicemail message with a supervisor, except in extreme emergencies. In cases that
warrant leaving a voicemail message or when an employee’s direct supervisor is unavailable, a follow-up call
must be made later that day.

If an illness or emergency occurs during work hours, employees should notify their supervisor as soon as
possible.

Employees who are going to be absent for more than one day, should contact their supervisor on each day of
their absence. <span  class="c_name"><?php echo $this->session->userdata('company_name'); ?></span> reserves
the right to ask for a physician’s statement in the event of a long-term illness (three consecutive days), or
multiple illnesses or injuries.

If an employee fails to notify their supervisor after three consecutive days of absence, <span
class="c_name"><?php echo $this->session->userdata('company_name'); ?></span> will presume that the employee
has voluntarily resigned. <span  class="c_name"><?php echo $this->session->userdata('company_name'); ?></span>
will review any extenuating circumstances that may have prevented him or her from calling in before the
employee is removed from payroll.

Should undue or recurrent absence and tardiness become apparent, the employee will be subject to disciplinary
action, up to and including termination of employment.

This policy is not intended to restrict an employee’s right to discuss, or act together to improve, wages,
benefits and working conditions with co-workers or in any way restrict employees’ rights under the National
Labor Relations Act.
